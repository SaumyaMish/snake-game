### Snake Game using Python Turtle

#### Snake Game Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, which causes the snake to grow longer. The objective is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

#### How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaumyaMish/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### Controls

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
- Press 'Esc' to exit the game.

#### Game Features

- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- Game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.
- Score is displayed on the screen.

#### Dependencies

- Python Turtle module (no additional installation required).
